# BayesianStatistics 
### Course of the Data Science Masters 
#### http://www.ub.edu/datascience/master/
Here I uploaded the computational projects I have completed for this course. The contents of the projects are:
* Project 1:
  * Sampling/Simulation from the Posterior 
  * Inverse cdf transform
  * Bayesian Binomial Model
* Project 2:
  * Laplace Approximation
  * Independent Monte Carlo sampling: Accept-Reject Method
  * Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling: Metropolis Hastings Algorithm
* Final Project:
  * Application of Bayesian Models to model Customer Lifetime Value using data from my job at TeamCMP
